Bus data information (Sbase = 1 MVA, Vbase = 12.66 kV)
 - 1st column: Bus index number
 - 2nd column: Bus type (1 = Slack, 2 = PV, 3 = PQ)

 - 3rd column: Active power generation (in PU)
 - 4th column: Reactive power generation (in PU)
 
 - 5th column: Active power load (in PU)
 - 6th column: Reactive power load (in PU)
 
 - 7th column: Voltage magnitude (in PU)
 - 8th column: Reactive power load (in degree)

Line data information 
 - 1st column: Bus index number
 - 2nd column: Bus index number
  --> Which means that Buses in the same row of 1st column and 2nd column are connected with line
 
 - 3rd column: Line resistance  (in per unit)
 - 4th column: Line reactance (in per unit)
 - 5th column: Line susceptance (in per unit, usually neglected in distribution line)
